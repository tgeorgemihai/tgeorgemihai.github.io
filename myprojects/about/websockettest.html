<h4>Node.js and WebSocket Multiplayer Test</h4>
<p>This is a video from a test project I've made a while ago.</p>
<p>I've made the server in Node.js using WebSocket library and application in Construct 2. All the logic is inside the application, the server only stores the list of users (hosts, clients) and passes the websockets (messages) between them.</p>
<p>The window from the left is the host. The other windows are the clients that receive the x,y coordinates of the object.</p>
